  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Onyx is the local client. On first connect (`onyx user@host`) it will
      provision `onyx-server` on the remote host over SSH.

      Make sure UDP 7272 is reachable to your remote hosts, or pass
      `--no-fallback` to disable the SSH transport fallback.

      Security model (TOFU + fingerprint pinning) is documented at
      https://github.com/shervin9/onyx/blob/main/SECURITY.md
